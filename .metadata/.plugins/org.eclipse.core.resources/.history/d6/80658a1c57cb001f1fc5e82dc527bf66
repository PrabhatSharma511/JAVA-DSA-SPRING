Tree is a hierarchical data structure. In tree traversal -1 indicates a null node.
Preorder traversal - first comes the Root then left subtree and then right subtree
Time complexity for preorder traversal is O(n) because we got to each node one by one

Inorder traversal - root comes in middle, first left subtree then root then right subtree.

BFS traversal of tree is level order traversal
DFS traversal of tree is inorder,postorder,preorder because in that we are going into depth

going from root to deepest leaf is height of tree

Diameter of Tree - Number of Nodes in the Longest path between any 2 nodes

Binary Search Tree - it is known so because of the search operation takes O(h) time where h is height of tree
and in average cases logn is height of tree so search in BST takes O(logn) time whereas in normal tree
search takes O(n) time
