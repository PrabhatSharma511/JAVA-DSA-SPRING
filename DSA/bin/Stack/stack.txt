A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
Key Operations on Stack Data Structures
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
IsFull: Checks if the stack is full (in case of fixed-size arrays).

In code Stack can be implemented in 3 ways Arrays,ArrayList,LinkedList.
Stack is implicit and explicit, implicit is made in code or memory like in recursion and explicit is stack is made by us.
